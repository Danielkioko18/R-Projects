# 🦇 Bat Echolocation Analysis – R Capstone Projects
## Overview

This repository contains a collection of R-based capstone projects focused on bat echolocation analysis. Each project follows the same problem statement, dataset, and core instructions, but differs in implementation, modeling approaches, and analytical techniques.

The goal of this repository is to compare multiple machine learning and statistical modeling strategies for analyzing and classifying bat echolocation calls using R.

## Project Objective

Bat echolocation signals provide valuable insights into species identification, behavior, and environmental interactions. The primary objectives of these projects are to:

- Analyze bat echolocation call data

- Perform data preprocessing and feature engineering

- Apply different machine learning models for classification and prediction

- Compare model performance and interpret results

 - Demonstrate reproducible data science workflows in R

## Tools and Technologies

- Programming Language: R

- Key Libraries: tidyverse, caret, randomForest, e1071, ggplot2, dplyr

- Development Environment: RStudio

## How to Use This Repository

1. Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-username/bat-echolocation-capstone.git

Navigate to any project folder.

Run the R scripts in order to reproduce the analysis.
